Import whole emoji directories to Slack with ease!

## Introduction
Remember how you had to add emojis to Slack by hand and just copy the name from the file? Those days are gone with this little Python script. Just give it name of your team, path to emojis on your computer, log into the browser (guaranteed to be safe or your money back) and let the script add ALL the emoticons for you!
